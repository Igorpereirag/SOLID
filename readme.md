The SOLID principles are a set of five software design principles aimed at creating more comprehensible, flexible, and sustainable systems.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility in the system. This principle encourages designing classes with a distinct and singular purpose.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This implies that new features can be added without altering existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a base class should be replaceable with objects of a derived class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without changing program behavior.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
A class should not be compelled to implement interfaces it does not use. This prevents a class from having methods that are irrelevant to its functionality.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, to decouple higher-level and lower-level modules for increased flexibility and maintainability.
